# Dispute Resolution Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for handling disputes in the MentorsMind escrow system. Disputes arise when there's a disagreement between learners and mentors regarding service delivery or payment.

## Dispute Lifecycle

```
Normal Flow:     pending → funded → released
                                    
Dispute Flow:    pending → funded → disputed → resolved → released/refunded
```

## When to Open a Dispute

### Valid Reasons for Disputes

**Learner-Initiated:**
- Mentor did not show up for scheduled session
- Service quality significantly below expectations
- Mentor did not deliver agreed-upon materials
- Session ended prematurely without valid reason
- Mentor violated platform terms of service

**Mentor-Initiated:**
- Learner did not show up for scheduled session
- Learner was abusive or violated terms of service
- Technical issues prevented service delivery (learner's fault)
- Learner requested services outside agreed scope

### Invalid Reasons

- Minor scheduling conflicts that were resolved
- Personality differences (unless involving harassment)
- Disagreements about teaching style (unless service was not delivered)
- Buyer's remorse without valid service issue

## Opening a Dispute

### Step 1: Attempt Direct Resolution

Before opening a formal dispute, parties should:
1. Communicate directly through platform messaging
2. Document the issue with screenshots/evidence
3. Attempt to reach a mutual agreement
4. Allow 24-48 hours for response

### Step 2: File Dispute

If direct resolution fails:

**API Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/escrow/:id/dispute`

**Required Information:**
```json
{
  "reason": "Detailed explanation of the issue (minimum 10 characters)"
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Be specific and factual
- Include dates and times
- Reference any prior communication
- Attach evidence if available
- Remain professional

### Step 3: Dispute Review Period

Once a dispute is opened:
- Escrow status changes to `disputed`
- Funds are frozen and cannot be released
- Both parties are notified
- Admin review is initiated
- Response period: 3-5 business days

## Admin Review Process

### Investigation Steps

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Review dispute reason
   - Check escrow details
   - Verify user histories
   - Identify any policy violations

2. **Evidence Collection**
   - Request additional information from both parties
   - Review platform logs (session attendance, messages)
   - Check Stellar transaction records
   - Examine user ratings and past disputes

3. **Communication**
   - Contact both parties for their side of the story
   - Request supporting documentation
   - Set deadlines for responses (typically 48 hours)
   - Document all communications

4. **Decision Making**
   - Evaluate all evidence objectively
   - Apply platform policies consistently
   - Consider precedent from similar cases
   - Make final resolution decision

### Resolution Options

**Option 1: Release to Mentor**
```json
{
  "resolution": "release_to_mentor",
  "notes": "Evidence shows service was delivered as agreed."
}
```

**When to Use:**
- Service was delivered as described
- Learner's complaint is unsubstantiated
- Minor issues that don't warrant refund
- Mentor provided reasonable accommodation

**Option 2: Refund to Learner**
```json
{
  "resolution": "refund_to_learner",
  "notes": "Mentor failed to deliver agreed service."
}
```

**When to Use:**
- Service was not delivered
- Significant quality issues
- Mentor violated terms of service
- Technical failure on mentor's side

**Option 3: Partial Resolution**
For partial refunds or split decisions:
1. Resolve dispute with primary decision
2. Process manual adjustment if needed
3. Document reasoning in resolution notes

## Resolution Execution

### API Endpoint

}
```

**Authorization:** Admin only

## Appendix

### Sample Dispute Reasons

**Good Examples:**
- "Mentor did not join the scheduled session on March 20, 2024 at 2:00 PM UTC. I waited 30 minutes and sent 3 messages with no response."
- "The session ended after only 15 minutes instead of the agreed 60 minutes. Mentor claimed technical issues but did not offer to reschedule."

**Poor Examples:**
- "Bad session" (too vague)
- "I don't like the mentor" (not a valid reason)
- "Changed my mind" (buyer's remorse)

### Resolution Templates

**Template 1: Service Delivered**
```
After reviewing the evidence, including session logs and communications, 
I have determined that the mentor fulfilled their obligations. The session 
occurred as scheduled and lasted the agreed duration. The learner's 
concerns about teaching style are subjective and do not constitute a 
breach of service agreement.

Resolution: Release funds to mentor
```

**Template 2: Service Not Delivered**
```
The evidence shows that the mentor did not attend the scheduled session 
and did not communicate any cancellation or rescheduling. Multiple 
attempts by the learner to contact the mentor went unanswered. This 
constitutes a failure to deliver the agreed service.

Resolution: Refund to learner
```
